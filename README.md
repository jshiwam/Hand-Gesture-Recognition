# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
Using Python And OpenCV
1. Run the python files on Pyhtom IDE(I used Spyder).
2.Make Sure to Install all the libraries before executing the files(OpenCV,Numpy).
3.To play songs show 2 fingers(V sign) in the window.
4.To open a website show 3 fingers in the window.
5.To play a movie show 4 fingers in the window.
6.To shutdown the computer show 5 fingers in the window.
7.Make sure that the Palm of the hand lies in the window.

For movie and song you have to save them in the same directory where the python file is. I have used "Stargazing"(song) and "Tramsformers"(movie) if you want to play anyother movies then change the name of the song/movie in the python script.

Thank You!
